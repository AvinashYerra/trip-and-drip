# Trip and Drip

Trip and Drip is a creative and imaginative web app that takes any two user-provided inputs—such as an artist and a mood—and generates unique suggestions for:

- Travel Destinations (Trip tab)
- Fashion Inspirations (Drip tab)

From aesthetic getaways to curated style ideas, Trip and Drip transforms your cultural inputs into thoughtful recommendations.

## Features

- Custom Input Suggestions  
  Enter any two concepts (e.g., "Coldplay" + "Sunset") and get meaningful suggestions.

- Trip Tab  
  Suggests travel destinations inspired by your input combination.

- Drip Tab  
  Generates fashion outfit ideas based on the input theme.

- AI-Powered Results  
  Uses Google's Gemini API to generate creative and relevant suggestions.

- Fully Frontend  
  Built entirely with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. No backend required.

## How It Works

1. The user enters any two free-form inputs such as a mood, artist, activity, or concept.
2. Based on the selected tab (Trip or Drip), the app sends the input pair to the Gemini API.
3. Gemini returns a relevant travel destination or fashion suggestion.
4. The result is displayed instantly through a clean and responsive interface.
